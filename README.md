# README
This repo is part of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data for course assignment.  The main objective is to tidy the UCI HAR Dataset - [Original Description]((http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)) - [Original Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)  This should be done in 5 steps.

A description of the data is available at [codebook](CodeBook.md)


#Steps
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

```r
# This code will merge data
```

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

```r
# Extract data
```

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

```r
# Describe activity names
```


4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

```r
# appropriately label
```

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

```r
# create a second independent tidy data set
```
